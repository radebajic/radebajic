I'm a civil engineer with a real passion for bringing order to complex projects, especially when it comes to scheduling, delay analysis, and navigating the ins and outs of FIDIC contracts. Over the years, I've found that the combination of technical expertise and a clear, straightforward approach helps me make sense of even the most complicated challenges.

Right now, I’m working on my third master’s degree — this time in Data Analytics at Georgia Tech. Yes, you read that right: third! I’m 41 and still hungry to keep learning, especially when it comes to using data to solve real-world problems. It’s been fascinating to see how data analysis can sharpen decision-making, and I'm excited to bring that into my day-to-day work. Keeping one eye on ML.

As a father of two girls, I am still learning that communication is key — whether I’m explaining why bedtimes matter or walking a project team through a complex delay scenario. My goal is always to break things down in a way that makes sense to everyone involved, so we can make smart decisions and keep things moving forward smoothly.
