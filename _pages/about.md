I'm a civil engineer with a real passion for bringing order to complex projects, especially when it comes to scheduling, delay analysis, and navigating the ins and outs of FIDIC contracts. Over the years, I've found that the combination of technical expertise and a clear, straightforward approach helps me make sense of even the most complicated challenges.

Currently, I’m working on my third master’s degree — this time in Data Analytics at Georgia Tech. Yes, you read that right: third! At 41, I’m still driven to keep learning, especially in using data to solve real-world problems. It’s fascinating to see how data analysis can sharpen decision-making. Keeping an eye on ML.

As a father of two girls, I’m constantly learning that communication is key — whether it’s explaining why bedtimes matter or guiding a project team through a complex delay scenario. My goal is to break down concepts in a way that makes sense to everyone involved, enabling smart decisions and smooth progress.
